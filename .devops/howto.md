# How-To Guide: Jobs & Governance in Databricks

This guide explains how we manage **jobs**, **permissions**, **views**, and **governance** in our Databricks environment.  
Terraform is no longer used â€” everything is handled with **Databricks notebooks + config files**.

---

## 1. Jobs

### Where Jobs Are Defined
- Jobs are stored in:
```

.devops/jobs.json

````

### How to Deploy Jobs
- From CLI:
```bash
databricks jobs create --json-file .devops/jobs.json
````

* To update an existing job:

  ```bash
  databricks jobs reset --job-id <JOB_ID> --json-file .devops/jobs.json
  ```
* In CI/CD pipelines (`azure-pipelines.yaml`), these commands are automated.

---

## 2. Governance & Permissions

### Where Permissions Are Defined

* Governance rules live in:

  ```
  configs/governance/permissions.yaml
  ```

Example:

```yaml
permissions:
  - object: "cfp.raw"
    type: "SCHEMA"
    grants:
      - principal: "data_engineers"
        privileges: ["ALL PRIVILEGES"]

  - object: "cfp.refined.claims_summary"
    type: "VIEW"
    grants:
      - principal: "executives"
        privileges: ["SELECT"]
```

### How to Apply Governance

* Run:

  ```
  notebooks/governance/apply_permissions.py
  ```
* This notebook:

  1. Reads `permissions.yaml`.
  2. Builds `GRANT` statements.
  3. Applies access rules in Unity Catalog.

### How to Verify

* In Databricks SQL:

  ```sql
  SHOW GRANTS ON SCHEMA cfp.raw;
  SHOW GRANTS ON VIEW cfp.refined.claims_summary;
  ```
* Or use **Data Explorer â†’ Permissions tab**.

---

## 3. Identity & Groups

* Groups are **managed in Azure Active Directory (AAD)**, not in Databricks.
* They sync automatically to Databricks using **SCIM provisioning**.
* Current groups in use:

  * `data_engineers`
  * `bi_users`
  * `executives`

Add/remove members in AAD â†’ changes sync into Databricks automatically.

---

## 4. Views

### Where Views Are Defined

* View definitions are in:

  ```
  configs/refined/views.yaml
  ```

Example:

```yaml
views:
  - name: claims_summary
    schema: cfp.refined
    sql: |
      SELECT policy_id, COUNT(*) AS total_claims
      FROM cfp.harmonize.claims
      GROUP BY policy_id;
```

### How to Create Views

* Run:

  ```
  notebooks/refined/create_views.py
  ```
* The notebook:

  * Reads `views.yaml`.
  * Runs `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` statements.
  * Registers views in Unity Catalog.

---

## 5. CI/CD Integration

* Pipeline config:

  ```
  .devops/azure-pipelines.yaml
  ```
* Typical pipeline steps:

  1. Run tests (`pytest`).
  2. Deploy jobs (`jobs.json`).
  3. Apply governance (`apply_permissions.py`).
  4. Create/update views (`create_views.py`).

---

## âœ… Summary

* **Jobs** â†’ defined in `.devops/jobs.json` â†’ deployed via CLI/CI.
* **Governance** â†’ config-driven (`permissions.yaml`) â†’ applied with `apply_permissions.py`.
* **Views** â†’ config-driven (`views.yaml`) â†’ applied with `create_views.py`.
* **Groups** â†’ managed in Azure AD, synced automatically into Databricks.

This keeps the platform **fully config-driven**, auditable in Git, and executed inside **Databricks notebooks** â€” no Terraform required.

```

Would you like me to also draft a **short README section** at repo root (`README.md`) that links to this `.devops/howto.md` so new contributors immediately know where to look for governance & jobs setup?
